for thousands of genes simultaneously. In time-course
experiments in which gene expression is monitored over time, we
are interested in testing gene expression profiles for different
experimental groups. However, no sophisticated analytic methods
have yet been proposed  to handle time-course experiment data.Results: We propose a statistical test procedure
based on the ANOVA model to identify genes that
have different gene expression profiles among experimental
groups in time-course experiments. Especially,
we propose a permutation test which does
not require the normality assumption. For this test,
we use residuals from the ANOVA model only with
time-effects. Using this test, we detect genes that
have different gene expression profiles among experimental
groups. The proposed model is illustrated
using cDNA microarrays of 3840 genes obtained in
an experiment to search for changes in gene expression
profiles during neuronal differentiation of cortical
stem cells.Availability: A set of programs written by R will be

The method can best be thought of as an analysis approach, to guide and assist in the use of any of a wide range of available clustering algorithms. We call the new methodology consensus clustering, and in conjunction with resampling techniques, it provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. Finally, it provides for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. We present the results of our experiments on both simulated data and real gene expression data aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in discovering biologically meaningful clusters.",
