    abstract = "{Motivation: Microarray technology allows the monitoring of expression levels
for thousands of genes simultaneously. In time-course
experiments in which gene expression is monitored over time, we
are interested in testing gene expression profiles for different
experimental groups. However, no sophisticated analytic methods
have yet been proposed  to handle time-course experiment data.Results: We propose a statistical test procedure
based on the ANOVA model to identify genes that
have different gene expression profiles among experimental
groups in time-course experiments. Especially,
we propose a permutation test which does
not require the normality assumption. For this test,
we use residuals from the ANOVA model only with
time-effects. Using this test, we detect genes that
have different gene expression profiles among experimental
groups. The proposed model is illustrated
using cDNA microarrays of 3840 genes obtained in
an experiment to search for changes in gene expression
profiles during neuronal differentiation of cortical
stem cells.Availability: A set of programs written by R will be
